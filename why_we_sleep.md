# Why We Sleep

## Part 1: This Thing Called Sleep

### Chapter 1: To Sleep

* 2/3 of adults in all developed nations fail to obtain the recommended 8 hours of sleep each night.
* Routine lack of sleep has a host of detrimental health impacts, including:
  * Demolishing your immune system
  * Doubling risk for cancer
  * Increased risk of developing Alzheimer's
  * Blood sugar disruption
  * Increased risk of coronary artery blockage (and thus increased risk of strokes, cardiovascular disease, etc...)
  * Contributes to all major psychiatric conditions (e.g. depression, anxiety, and suicidality)
  * Overeating
  * Shorter lifespans in general
* The World Health Organization (WHO) has declared a sleep loss epidemic in industrialized nations.
* We are asleep for approximately 1/3 of our lives.
* Historically, people trying to understand sleep sought to find a single purpose for it (and always failed to do so).
* But just as we do many things during the 2/3 of our waking lives, we many different things during the 1/3 of our lives spent sleeping.
* Sleep is complex and serves a wide variety of functions.
* All major organs and brain processes are enhaned by sleep (and suffer from a lack of it).
* Sleep is even more important than exercise and a healthy diet.
* One bad night of sleep results in significant mental and physical impairments (far more so than missed exercise or a bad meal).
* Sleep is the single most effective thing we can do to reset our brain and body health each day.

### Chapter 2: Caffeine, Jet Lag, and Melatonin

* There are two main factors that determine when we want to be awake and asleep: our **circadian rhythm** and **adenosine concentration**.
* Your circadian rhythm is an internal ~24 hour clock (circa=day, dian=day).
* Nearly all processes in the human body are influenced by the circadian rhythm.
* Everyone's circadian rhythm rises and falls over the course of a day (it looks like a sine wave when plotted).
* On average, the circadian rhythm peaks around 12pm, and hits a low point around 12am.
* Not everyone's circadian rhythm is the same, however. It is typically shifted to the left or right, to varying degrees depending on the individual.
* The circadian rhythm of morning people ('morning larks') is shifted to the left. It peaks sometime before noon.
* The circadian rhythm of evening people ('night owls') is shifted to the right. It peaks sometime after noon.
* The organ responsible for generating your circadian rhythm is the **suprachiasmatic nucleus**. 
* It is a small cluster of neurons located above the crossing point of your two optic nerves.
* It samples the light information from the optic nerves to reset itself and prevent drift to ensure crisp 24 hour cycles.
* The suprachiasmatic nucleus causes the pineal gland to release **melatonin** into your bloodstream soon after dusk each day.
* Melatonin helps regulate the 'timing' of sleep - but not the 'generation' of sleep.
* As such, while melatonin supplements can help when you're having trouble sleeping (e.g. jet lag), they are not a silver bullet.
* Adenosine is a chemical that builds up in the brain while you are awake, and which is degraded during sleep.
* High concentrations of adenosine cause you to feel sleepy. This is known as **sleep pressure**.
* Sleep pressure can be artificially muted by consuming caffeine (which is the second most traded commodity on the planet, after oil).
* Caffeine works by latching on to adenosine receptors in the brain. But unlike adenosine, caffeine does not stimulate these receptors.
* Adenosine continues to build up even while caffeine has stolen the receptors. When the caffeine is degraded, the adenosine comes crashing in.
* Your circadian rhythm and adenosine concentration are separate and distinct processes.
* They usually work in lockstep, but can get out of sync if you mess up your sleep schedule or routine.
* The urge to sleep is stronger when adenosine concentrations are high and the circadian rhythm is low.

### Chapter 3: Defining and Generating Sleep

* There are two types of sleep: NREM (non-rapid eye movement) and REM (rapid eye movement) sleep.
* NREM itself is subdivided into 4 stages, each with increasing "depth".
* A single night of sleep is divided into several cycles. 
* Each cycle begins with a period of NREM sleep, followed by a period of REM sleep.
* For most of the night, the ratio of NREM to REM sleep per cycle remains high. But the ratio begins to change in favor of REM sleep as the night wears on.
* Because most REM sleep occurs during sleep cycles later in the night, waking up 'just' 2 hours (25%) prematurely results in a loss of 60-90% of REM sleep.
* The electrical activity of the brain during each of the following states (1) wakefulness, (2) deep NREM sleep, and (3) REM sleep is as follows:
  1. Noisy waves. No discernible patterns.
  2. Highly synchronous waves. Obvious discernible patterns.
  3. Noisy waves. Electrical signature is very similar to wakeful brain activity.
* During NREM sleep, the thalamus blocks all sensory inputs to the cortex.
* The slow, synchronous waves of NREM sleep allow distant regions of the brain to communicate.
* During NREM sleep, the brain transfers memory from fragile, short-term storage to safer, long-term locations.
* During REM sleep, the thalamus reopens the sensory gate. 
* But it does not allow external sensory signals through. Rather, it is opened to emotions, motivations, and memories.
* During REM sleep, the brain is active and functioning similar to a wakeful state. This includes generation of motor commands.
* The brain integrates memories and experiences during REM sleep. This enhances your understanding of the world with innovative insights and problem-solving abilities.
* To prevent your body from physically reacting to the 'hallucinations' of REM sleep, the brain releases a powerful disabling signal seconds before REM sleep begins.
* This signal induces "atonia", effectively paralyzing your body and making you completely limp.
