# Why We Sleep

## Part 1: This Thing Called Sleep

### Chapter 1: To Sleep

* 2/3 of adults in all developed nations fail to obtain the recommended 8 hours of sleep each night.
* Routine lack of sleep has a host of detrimental health impacts, including:
  * Demolishing your immune system
  * Doubling risk for cancer
  * Increased risk of developing Alzheimer's
  * Blood sugar disruption
  * Increased risk of coronary artery blockage (and thus increased risk of strokes, cardiovascular disease, etc...)
  * Contributes to all major psychiatric conditions (e.g. depression, anxiety, and suicidality)
  * Overeating
  * Shorter lifespans in general
* The World Health Organization (WHO) has declared a sleep loss epidemic in industrialized nations.
* We are asleep for approximately 1/3 of our lives.
* Historically, people trying to understand sleep sought to find a single purpose for it (and always failed to do so).
* But just as we do many things during the 2/3 of our waking lives, we many different things during the 1/3 of our lives spent sleeping.
* Sleep is complex and serves a wide variety of functions.
* All major organs and brain processes are enhaned by sleep (and suffer from a lack of it).
* Sleep is even more important than exercise and a healthy diet.
* One bad night of sleep results in significant mental and physical impairments (far more so than missed exercise or a bad meal).
* Sleep is the single most effective thing we can do to reset our brain and body health each day.

### Chapter 2: Caffeine, Jet Lag, and Melatonin

* There are two main factors that determine when we want to be awake and asleep: our **circadian rhythm** and **adenosine concentration**.
* Your circadian rhythm is an internal ~24 hour clock (circa=day, dian=day).
* Nearly all processes in the human body are influenced by the circadian rhythm.
* Everyone's circadian rhythm rises and falls over the course of a day (it looks like a sine wave when plotted).
* On average, the circadian rhythm peaks around 12pm, and hits a low point around 12am.
* Not everyone's circadian rhythm is the same, however. It is typically shifted to the left or right, to varying degrees depending on the individual.
* The circadian rhythm of morning people ('morning larks') is shifted to the left. It peaks sometime before noon.
* The circadian rhythm of evening people ('night owls') is shifted to the right. It peaks sometime after noon.
* The organ responsible for generating your circadian rhythm is the **suprachiasmatic nucleus**. 
* It is a small cluster of neurons located above the crossing point of your two optic nerves.
* It samples the light information from the optic nerves to reset itself and prevent drift to ensure crisp 24 hour cycles.
* The suprachiasmatic nucleus causes the pineal gland to release **melatonin** into your bloodstream soon after dusk each day.
* Melatonin helps regulate the 'timing' of sleep - but not the 'generation' of sleep.
* As such, while melatonin supplements can help when you're having trouble sleeping (e.g. jet lag), they are not a silver bullet.
* Adenosine is a chemical that builds up in the brain while you are awake, and which is degraded during sleep.
* High concentrations of adenosine cause you to feel sleepy. This is known as **sleep pressure**.
* Sleep pressure can be artificially muted by consuming caffeine (which is the second most traded commodity on the planet, after oil).
* Caffeine works by latching on to adenosine receptors in the brain. But unlike adenosine, caffeine does not stimulate these receptors.
* As such,
