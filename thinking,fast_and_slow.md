# Thinking, Fast and Slow

## Part 1: Two Systems

### Chapter 1: The Characters of the Story

* Our mind contains two distinct modes of operation: 'fast' and 'slow'.
* The two modes generally operate concurrently. 
* The 'fast' mode is named System 1. The 'slow' mode is named System 2.
* It seems as though System 1 is always active, whereas System 2 is sometimes active.
* System 1 operates efficiently and effortlessly. System 2 operates only with conscious effort and is mentally intensive.
* We tend to identify with System 2. Perhaps this is because we are often not conscious of what is happening in System 1?
* System 1 is constantly generating impressions, intuitions, intentions, and feelings that are provided to System 2.
* System 2 can choose to override the outputs of System 1, based on reason and logic (perhaps other reasons too?).
* System 1 and System 2 are fictitious. They are no recognizable biological entities in our brains that give rise to them.
* System 1 and System 2 are simply useful names for recognizable psychological phenomena that give rise to mental biases.
* **Side Note:** Sentences are easier to understand when they describe what an agent does, rather than properties it has.
* **Side Note:** Words that take longer to say occupy more space in your working memory, and thereby reduce your ability to think. 

### Chapter 2: Attention and Effort

* Our pupils are very good indicators of mental effort and System 2 activity levels.
* Our pupils dilate as we expend more mental effort on a task.
* The Add-1 experiment is designed to fill a subject's working memory and heighten System 2 activity.
* The Add-1 experiment (and others like it) reliably dilate the subject's pupils as more effort is expended.
* Observers can determine when a participant gives up on a task based solely on the contraction of the subject's pupils.
* When you are mentally sprinting (System 2 is working hard), you become effectively blind to everything you are not focusing on.
* It is very difficult to perform multiple System 2 tasks concurrently because our working memory fills up quickly.

### Chapter 3: The Lazy Controller

* It is easy and stimulating to think while walking at low speeds. But not if the thinking requires deliberate thought or self-control.
* Many cognitive tasks (those that use System 2) require concentration and exertion of self-control. 
* Ego depletion occurs when a person performs multiple tasks (simultaneously of sequentially) that require mental effort and self-control.
* The brain uses more glucose when ego depletion occurs. Consuming glucose may help reverse ego depletion.
* As your ego is depleted, subsequent tasks become more difficult and you're more likely to resort to the easier default behaviors of System 1.
* Flow states allow you to perform tasks that require concentration and use of System 2 effortlessly for long periods of time without ego depletion.
* A study found that Israeli parole judges suffer from ego depletion. As the judges become more hungry, they denied more parole requests.
* In most people, System 2 is lazy. (I suspect it is lazy in all people, but to differing degrees.)
* Most people avoid using it more than necessary and rely heavily upon System 1. (I suspect this happens most often when one is uninterested in the problem at hand.)
* Studies show that cognitive control and intelligence are correlated in many individuals. 
* Some psychologists believe that there are two independent and distinct parts of System 2: rationality and intelligence

### Chapter 4: The Associative Machine

* Our minds automatically construct **associatively coherent** graphs of thoughts.
* Our minds maintain an internal graph where the nodes are concepts.
* These concepts are linked in various ways, e.g. `causes -> effects`, `things -> properties`, `things -> categories`.
* When exposed to stimuli, our minds automatically begin to traverse the graph centered at the node(s) representing the stimuli.
* This graph traversal is performed by System 1. Only a subset of the activated nodes will register in the consciousness of System 2.
* In 1748, David Hume identified 3 of the rules that explain the associativity of ideas: resemblance, contiguity in time and place, and causality.
* In the 1908s, researchers discovered that exposure to a word influences the ease with which related works can be evoked.
* E.g. after exposure to the word `EAT`, participants are more likely to complete `SO_P` as `SOUP` than as `SOAP`.
* This is an example of the **priming effect**.
* Our minds are susceptible to the priming effect (though System 2 is unconscious of this phenomenon).
* The priming effect takes many forms. It can be triggered by any stimuli, not just words. And it influences our behavior, not just our thoughts.
* E.g. when unconsciously made to smile (by holding a pencil in their mouths), participants find things more funny than when they are made to frown.
* If you "act calm and kind regardless of how you feel", then you are likely to actually feel more calm and kind. (and vice versa!)
* Money tends to prime people for individualism. Similarly, cultures that present large images of the "Dear Leader" suppress independent thoughts and actions.

### Chapter 5: Cognitive Ease

* Our brains measure how well 'things are going' via a 'dial' known as **cognitive ease**.
* Cognitive ease ranges between `easy` and `strained` values and is part of System 1.
* There are several inputs that influence cognitive ease. And cognitive ease impacts our state of mind in numerous ways.
* Cognitive ease is influenced by the availability of related experiences, display clarity, whether an idea is primed, and overall good mood.
* Cognitive ease affects our mood by making things feel familiar, true, good, and effortless.
* The inputs to cognitive ease are interchangeable. This results in a funnelling/merging effect of cognitive ease inputs.
* As such, when you notice a change in cognitive ease, it is difficult to trace it back to a specific input.
* High levels of cognitive ease make one feel that an experience/input is familiar. As such, people think that names presented in clear and crisp fonts are more familiar.
* Repetition induces cognitive ease and comforting feelings of familiarity. This is called the **mere exposure effect**.
* As a general rule, the mere exposure effect predicts that the more you are exposed to something, the more comfortable you will feel around it.
* And conversely, new/novel/unfamiliar stimuli will make you feel uncomfortable.
* High cognitive ease is associated with increased reliance on System 1. And low cognitive ease is associated with increased reliance on System 2.
* A consequence of cognitive ease and the mere exposure effect is that the more you hear or see something, the more good and true it will seem (regardless of whether it actually is).

### Chapter 6: Norms, Surprises, and Causes

* Our heads contain a powerful computer that represents the structure of our world with associative links in a network of concepts/ideas.
* The spreading of activation in this network is automatic (System 1), but we (System 2) have a limited ability to control memory searches. 
* We also can program it so that detection of an event in the environment attracts our attention.
* System 1 maintains an internal model of our world that represents spatial and temporal patterns we experience (primarily over short time spans).
* When this internal model is violated, we experience surprise. 
* The capacity for surprise is essential to our mental life and is a sensitive indicator of how we understand the world.
* System 1 automatically learns which events are to be considered normal/expected.
* When a particular event occurs more than once, System 1 will begin to consider it normal. (Even if the the event is actually abnormal, and the recurrence was mere coincidence.)
* System 1 is extremely adept at finding causal connections between successive events in time. System 2 will generally accept explanations offered by System 1 at face value.
* System 1 "finds" causal connections even when no such connections exist. (This is a major pitfall in human thinking.)
* System 1 is primed to identify 2 types of causality: physical and intentional
* Physical causality explains how "dumb" physical phenomena occur. Such as when a moving object impacts an inanimate object, which then begins to move.
* Intentional causality explains how "free willed" actions occur. Such as picking up a salt shaker. (Thus, technically speaking, intentional causality is a subtype of physical causality.)
* Paul Bloom (a psychologist) believes that this deep rooted tendency to distinguish physical and intentional causality might explain the ubiquity of religion across cultures.
