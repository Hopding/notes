# Thinking, Fast and Slow

## Part 1: Two Systems

### Chapter 1: The Characters of the Story

* Our mind contains two distinct modes of operation: 'fast' and 'slow'.
* The two modes generally operate concurrently. 
* The 'fast' mode is named System 1. The 'slow' mode is named System 2.
* It seems as though System 1 is always active, whereas System 2 is sometimes active.
* System 1 operates efficiently and effortlessly. System 2 operates only with conscious effort and is mentally intensive.
* We tend to identify with System 2. Perhaps this is because we are often not conscious of what is happening in System 1?
* System 1 is constantly generating impressions, intuitions, intentions, and feelings that are provided to System 2.
* System 2 can choose to override the outputs of System 1, based on reason and logic (perhaps other reasons too?).
* System 1 and System 2 are fictitious. They are no recognizable biological entities in our brains that give rise to them.
* System 1 and System 2 are simply useful names for recognizable psychological phenomena that give rise to mental biases.
* **Side Note:** Sentences are easier to understand when they describe what an agent does, rather than properties it has.
* **Side Note:** Words that take longer to say occupy more space in your working memory, and thereby reduce your ability to think. 

### Chapter 2: Attention and Effort

* Our pupils are very good indicators of mental effort and System 2 activity levels.
* Our pupils dilate as we expend more mental effort on a task.
* The Add-1 experiment is designed to fill a subject's working memory and heighten System 2 activity.
* The Add-1 experiment (and others like it) reliably dilate the subject's pupils as more effort is expended.
* Observers can determine when a participant gives up on a task based solely on the contraction of the subject's pupils.
* When you are mentally sprinting (System 2 is working hard), you become effectively blind to everything you are not focusing on.
* It is very difficult to perform multiple System 2 tasks concurrently because our working memory fills up quickly.

### Chapter 3: The Lazy Controller

* It is easy and stimulating to think while walking at low speeds. But not if the thinking requires deliberate thought or self-control.
* Many cognitive tasks (those that use System 2) require concentration and exertion of self-control. 
* Ego depletion occurs when a person performs multiple tasks (simultaneously of sequentially) that require mental effort and self-control.
* The brain uses more glucose when ego depletion occurs. Consuming glucose may help reverse ego depletion.
* As your ego is depleted, subsequent tasks become more difficult and you're more likely to resort to the easier default behaviors of System 1.
* Flow states allow you to perform tasks that require concentration and use of System 2 effortlessly for long periods of time without ego depletion.
* A study found that Israeli parole judges suffer from ego depletion. As the judges become more hungry, they denied more parole requests.
* In most people, System 2 is lazy. (I suspect it is lazy in all people, but to differing degrees.)
* Most people avoid using it more than necessary and rely heavily upon System 1. (I suspect this happens most often when one is uninterested in the problem at hand.)
* Studies show that cognitive control and intelligence are correlated in many individuals. 
* Some psychologists believe that there are two independent and distinct parts of System 2: rationality and intelligence
